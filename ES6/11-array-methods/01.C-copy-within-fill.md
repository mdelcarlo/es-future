## Array.prototype.copyWithin()

The signature of this method is:

- Array.prototype.copyWithin(target : number, start : number, end = this.length)

It copies the elements whose indices are in the range [start,end) to index target and subsequent indices. If the two index ranges overlap, care is taken that all source elements are copied before they are overwritten.

Example:

```js
const arr = [0, 1, 2, 3];
arr.copyWithin(2, 0, 2); //[ 0, 1, 0, 1 ]
arr; //[ 0, 1, 0, 1 ]
```

## Array.prototype.fill()

The signature of this method is:

- Array.prototype.fill(value : any, start=0, end=this.length)

It fills an Array with the given value:

```js
const arr = ["a", "b", "c"];
arr.fill(7); //[ 7, 7, 7 ]
arr; //[ 7, 7, 7 ]
```

Optionally, you can restrict where the filling starts and ends:

```js
["a", "b", "c"].fill(7, 1, 2); // [("a", 7, "c")];
```

### Creating Arrays filled with values

Holes being treated as undefined elements by the new ES6 operations helps with creating Arrays that are filled with values.

### Filling with a fixed value

Array.prototype.fill() replaces all Array elements (incl. holes) with a fixed value:

```js
new Array(3).fill(7); // [ 7, 7, 7 ]
```

new Array(3) creates an Array with three holes and fill() replaces each hole with the value 7.

### Filling with ascending numbers

Array.prototype.keys() reports keys even if an Array only has holes. It returns an iterable, which you can convert to an Array via the spread operator:

```js
[...new Array(3).keys()]; // [(0, 1, 2)];
```

### Filling with computed values

The mapping function in the second parameter of Array.from() is notified of holes. Therefore, you can use Array.from() for more sophisticated filling:

```js
Array.from(new Array(5), (x, i) => i * 2); // [ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 ]
```

### Filling with undefined

If you need an Array that is filled with undefined, you can use the fact that iteration (as triggered by the spread operator) converts holes to undefineds:

```js
[...new Array(3)]; // [(undefined, undefined, undefined)];
```

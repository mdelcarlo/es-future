# New Array.prototype methods

Several new methods are available for Array instances.

## Iterating over Arrays

The following methods help with iterating over Arrays:

- Array.prototype.entries()
- Array.prototype.keys()
- Array.prototype.values()

The result of each of the aforementioned methods is a sequence of values, but they are not returned as an Array; they are revealed one by one, via an iterator. Let’s look at an example. I’m using Array.from() to put the iterators’ contents into Arrays:

```js
Array.from(["Howard", "Dominique"].keys()); // [ 0, 1 ]
Array.from(["Howard", "Dominique"].values()); // [ 'Howrad', 'Dominique' ]
Array.from(["Howard", "Dominique"].entries()); // [ [ 0, 'Howrad' ],[ 1, 'Dominique' ] ]
```

I could also have used the spread operator (...) to convert iterators to Arrays:

```js
[...["Howard", "Dominique"].keys()]; // [0, 1];
```
